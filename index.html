                        With the resurgence in popularity of chess as well as the notion that it's cool to be good at chess, I've dusted off my old board and have begun playing once again.
                        Within my friend group, I've even garnered the nickname "chess fiend" much to my dismay. I don't really know how I feel about my chess enthusiasm being mistaken for 
                        an addiction. Regardless, the 10 minute online games available at chess.com have certainly saved me from my own boredom on multiple occasions.

                        I'm an avid typer and found that entering online typing competitions is a great way to pass the time (and distract me from actual work). I pride myself in being able to consistently
                        type above 100 words per minute and find solace in the fact that I can impress any one of my friends just by typing a paragraph for them. What started as a seemingly meaningless lesson
                        in my 9th grade english class, became a vital part in my daily routine. I would often find myself typing the url of my favorite
                        typing website subconsiously whenever opening chrome. I might have a problem...

                        Despite how much I get teased for it, I play games on a mac. However, I always come out on top when faced with adversity. I enjoy playing overwatch, league of legends, and valorant
                        as well as the occasional pokemon. I'm in the top 10% in each aforementioned game and will never shy away from some good old bragging towards my brother. Each game is largely team oriented
                        and I found that the leadership and teamwork skills I learned carried over to the school environment. In virtually every school project, I ended up taking the reins and deligating
                        tasks to fellow classmates. Both in game and in real life, it's just my mackbook and I against the world.

                        If you ever see me out in public, there's a good chance I'm wearing earbuds. I've been surrounded by music the majority of my life, thrusted into competitive piano at the age of 7.
                        While I've since quit the competitive scene, listening to music has certainly provided an escape from stress and anxiety. I mainly listen to mid 2000s pop songs. The main reason is
                        likely the nostalgic/up-beat tones of the music from that time. Outside of tha trend, I'll add any song I find good to my playlist, regardless of genre.

                        Frustrated with the lack of local opportunities due to the pandemic, I went to my Society of Software Developer's
                        <br>club and proposed the idea of making a weather tracking app using a weather API. With only one taker, we went to
                        <br>work immediately and made amazing progress in the few days we gave ourselves! Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and 
                        <br>ReactJS, our Weather Tracker takes city name input and dispalays the temperature (including min and max) as well as
                        <br>a neat icon to match the forcasted weather.

                        Decided to do something with my summer and learn something new. I was always curious as to how websites
                        <br>were made. At first, the task seemed pretty daunting, but after reading some tutorials the actual making
                        <br>of the website became easier. I decided to use bootstrap because of its beginner-friendly formatting
                        <br>that took away a lot of my frustrations. Overall, it's not the prettiest website, but I'm grateful
